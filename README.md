## Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – Synthetic Dataset Creation for SH EPA’s (Supporting DS Initiative)

This repository contains work completed in support of SH’s Final Data Science Project using the EPA framework. The focus is on analysing reported adverse reactions to Paracetamol during 2021, and creating a synthetic dataset for further machine learning (ML) experimentation.

# Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is #confidential and not available in this repository.

However, the included Python notebook enables other researchers to generate a synthetic version of the dataset in a short time. Using a randomised data generation approach, the notebook can create over 100,000 records that replicate the statistical structure of the original dataset without exposing sensitive information.

# Key Variables

The synthetic dataset contains 11 variables. Details are provided in the notebook for research and replication purposes.

# Technology & Methodology

The project is implemented in Python. Each main script includes clear, step-by-step guidance covering the complete synthetic data lifecycle—from variable design and randomisation logic to dataset generation and export.
